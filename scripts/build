# Build this particular package in the dist directory
## Customize as necessary.

## When this function is invoked:
### $ROOT is the root directory of the repo
### $DIST is the dist directory where the package should be built
### README and LICENSE are already copied from $ROOT to $DIST
### $ROOT/real.package.json is already copied to $DIST/package.json

### use success and error instead of echo to output any messages
### use fatal to display a fatal error and abort
